3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Using CLEmitter)
      Approach: I looked at the other Gen*.java files as an example. It helped me pieced together the code,
      also using the book to find many of the instructions needed. I first started by building the class as a empty husk.
      After I went through and implemented "main", since there were examples of it. isPrime was a little trickier, but I did one condition at a time.

      Issues and resolution: The issue was keeping track of the stack. Thanks to the error reporting. I figured out that my string buffer was 
      only accepting ints, when it should have been accepting strings. Another issue I had was my conditionals, because they jump to a label when they return
      true, it took me a little bit of time to piece together a proper flow.

   Problem 2 (Arithmetic Operations)
      Approach: This one was pretty easy, I looked at the other examples of unary and binary operators. The issue was building out the
      acceptance of the token, it took some searching to find the switch statement, and where to place the ast code.

      Issues and resolution: It was relatively straight forward to solve.

   Problem 3 (Bitwise Operations)
      Approach: It was pretty much the same as above.

      Issues and resolution: The issue was with the complement operation. I forgot that another way it 
      can be written is by XOR -1.

   Problem 4 (Shift Operations)
      Approach: Looked at the implentation of binary expressions. Built out the ast first to know where it falls under.

      Issues and resolution: The issue I had was figuring out how to properly nest the upcoming character, to make sure
      it lined up with the notation. As an example ">" but to know that the next character would be a ">" took some conditional nesting.

4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
